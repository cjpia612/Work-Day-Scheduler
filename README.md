# Work-Day-Scheduler
A work scheduler with dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Installation

Launch the website and the scheduler will run immediately. 

## Usage

The Work Day Scheduler displays the current day and date at the top of the page. The scheduler displays editable time blocks for a 9-5 work day. In the colored blocks, you can input text for event and save it using the calendar icon to the right of the block. After saving, the text will still stay in place even after refreshing the page. 

The time blocks are also color-coded to indicate whether the time has past, is present, or in the future. Past appears teal, present is yellow, and future is lavender.
